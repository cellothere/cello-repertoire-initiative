    earlyBeginner: `Left Hand:
  – Focus on basic setup: playing on open strings and first‐finger notes in 1st position only.
  – No shifting yet; the hand stays in place with no extensions.
  – The thumb rests behind the neck for support.
  – No vibrato is used at this stage, and any harmonics appear only as simple open–string effects.
  
  Right Hand:
  – Emphasis on a proper bow hold and straight bow strokes.
  – Use of basic détaché strokes on open strings to produce a clear, even tone.
  – Limited bow division—staying in the mid–bow region for control—and early rhythm exercises that focus on starting and stopping the bow cleanly.
  – Introduce simple string crossings between adjacent strings.
  
  Bow Strokes:
  – Primarily détaché strokes.
  – Basic on–string staccato is introduced by stopping the bow after each short note.
  – The bow remains on the string at all times.
  
  Rhythm & Musicality:
  – Use very simple rhythms (quarter and half notes, basic repeated patterns).
  – Pieces are short and typically in 2/4 or 4/4 time.
  – Phrasing is minimal, usually one or two–bar phrases with natural stops.
  – Dynamics are mostly steady while the focus is on producing a clear, in–tune tone.`,
    default: 'Levels are approximate.'
